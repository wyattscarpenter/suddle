This is suddle, a basic thingum I have contrived to demonstrate SDL to myself. I'm pretty sure I followed the beginning of https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/ because I found https://www.parallelrealities.co.uk/tutorials/ over-architected.

Things are pretty rough in this project because I just want to make games, man.

Unfortunately, the process to install SDL dependencies is pretty confusing I guess it's just https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-linux.md#build-dependencies

sudo apt-get install build-essential git make cmake autoconf automake libtool pkg-config libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libaudio-dev libjack-dev libx11-dev libxext-dev libxrandr-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxinerama-dev libxxf86vm-dev libxss-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libdbus-1-dev libudev-dev libgles2-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libibus-1.0-dev fcitx-libs-dev libsamplerate0-dev libsndio-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev libdrm-dev libgbm-dev

on my WSL, but I still don't know how to make a static exe or elf out of them...

I place this project into the public domain.
