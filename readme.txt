This is suddle, a basic thingum I have contrived to demonstrate SDL to myself. I'm pretty sure I am following https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/ because I found https://www.parallelrealities.co.uk/tutorials/ over-architected

Unfortunately, the process to install SDL dependencies is pretty bespoke... I haven't documented it here... I guess it's just https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/blob/main/docs/README-linux.md#build-dependencies on my WSL, but I still don't know how to make a static exe out of them...

Public domain.
